\usage{
  make_GXM(expFile = NULL, gxmFilePrefix = NULL,
    idfile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{expFile}{Path to gene expression file.}

  \item{gxmFilePrefix}{File path prefixes for outputting
  GCTA style binary correlation matrices.}

  \item{idfile}{Path to file containing family IDs and
  sample IDs with header FID and IID.}
}
\value{
  Returns a correlation matrix of (N-samples x N-samples),
  with rownames and colnames as sample IDs.
}
\description{
  This function computes a gene expression correlation
  matrix given a file of transcript expression levels for
  each sample in the study. It returns a correlation matrix
  with rownames and colnames as sample IDs.
